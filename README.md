<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Frost Law Firm Landing][frostlawfirm-landing]](https://frostlawfirm2.vercel.app/)

I used Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and styled-components. 
I also used SendGrid and Formik to submit customer contact information to a Frost Law Firm email account.
They wanted a "small mom and pop shop" feel and their clients are typically less tech-familiar seniors who may be diagnosed with cancer. I researched web accessibility and balanced design choices that reflected what I found with some aesthetics Frost Law Firm wanted. 

Frost Law Firm loved the site and had it deployed, but they ended up utilizing a marketing team that specializes in law that took over the consumer-facing website. They did use my website as inspiration.
